### 📌 **Project Title:**

**AutoVerse – OOP-Based Car Dealership & Service Management System**

---

### 📝 **Project Description:**

**AutoVerse** is a comprehensive, file-driven Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) application built in C++ to manage car dealership operations for buyers, sellers, and administrators. The system offers a complete solution for inventory management, secure transactions, maintenance tracking, and auction participation.

The application features a robust class hierarchy with inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading to reflect real-world entities such as vehicles, users, and inspections. Secure file handling mechanisms inspired by cybersecurity practices ensure confidentiality and integrity of user and vehicle data.
